# NBA-Team-Stats
A line of something ...
What was your motivation?
The reason for the creation of the NBA Stats website was to create a simple and easy to use layout to find out NBA statistics. For simple use it gives you the teams wins and losses and total points scored throughout the 2021 season. The code will put the data in an easy to manage object.
Using the knowledge of coding we have. We decided to use two API's and intergrate them individually for certain statistics. One for names and one for all around stats. Using javascript code was the simplest way to intergrate the APIs together. While implementing the code together some of the challenges that we faced were what data we had to extract from the APIs and what to show. 

Building the project was an inspiration of ours since we are fans of Basketball. Learning to implement different ways of coding for javascript and different css styles like Bulma adds to our knowledge of coding. Doing this project helped to understand JSON objects and using the local storage of a machine to identify and save markers for the website.

While the project has many items we would like to add including players and player stats with live updates on who scored and what quarter the match is it.
